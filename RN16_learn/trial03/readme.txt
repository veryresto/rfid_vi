Was suggested to increase reciver IQ rate for easier FM0 decoding process.

Turns out current IQ rate (2M) is enough. Decoding process can be done just with 2M IQ rate on receiver. 

Long signal which is symbol for bit 1 consist of straight 3 or 4 same bits. For example 111 or 0000 are considered as bit 1.

While bit 0 consist of 3 or 4 bits which is 2:2, 1:2, orf 2:1. For example 0011, 110, 011 are considered as bit 0.
